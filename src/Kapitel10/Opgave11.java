/**10.11 (Geometry: the Circle2D class) Define the Circle2D class that contains:
        ■■ Two double data fields named x and y that specify the center of the circle with getter methods.
        ■■ A data field radius with a getter method.
        ■■ A no-arg constructor that creates a default circle with (0, 0) for (x, y) and 1 for radius.
        ■■ A constructor that creates a circle with the specified x, y, and radius.
        ■■ A method getArea() that returns the area of the circle.
        ■■ A method getPerimeter() that returns the perimeter of the circle.
        ■■ A method contains(double x, double y) that returns true if the
        specified point (x, y) is inside this circle (see Figure 10.21a).
        ■■ A method contains(Circle2D circle) that returns true if the specified
        circle is inside this circle (see Figure 10.21b).
        ■■ A method overlaps(Circle2D circle) that returns true if the specified
        circle overlaps with this circle (see Figure 10.21c).*/
