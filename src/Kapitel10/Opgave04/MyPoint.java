/**10.4 (The MyPoint class) Design a class named MyPoint to represent a point with
 x- and y-coordinates. The class contains:
        ■■ The data fields x and y that represent the coordinates with getter methods.
        ■■ A no-arg constructor that creates a point (0, 0).
        ■■ A constructor that constructs a point with specified coordinates.
        ■■ A method named distance that returns the distance from this point to a
        specified point of the MyPoint type.
        ■■ A method named distance that returns the distance from this point to
        another point with specified x- and y-coordinates.
        ■■ A static method named distance that returns the distance from two MyPoint
        objects.
        Draw the UML diagram for the class then implement the class. Write a test
        program that creates the two points (0, 0) and (10, 30.5) and displays the distance
        between them.*//*

public class MyPoint {
    private int x;
    private int y;


    public MyPoint() {
        this.x = 0;
        this.y = 0;
    }

    public MyPoint(int x, int y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }

    public int distance(MyPoint x, MyPoint y){
        x.distance(y);

    }

    public int getX() {
        return x;
    }
    public int getY() {
        return y;
